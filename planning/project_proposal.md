## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?
Gym buddy, Camp b well. Camp b well doesnt have social features that allow you to connect with other people and Gym buddy is just for the gym and not wellness in general.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

How would we do it at salesforce scale?
How many recommendations do we want to limit people at?
Do we want to calculate every 24 hours or real time updates AKA?
How would we compare the preferences in the database?
What would we rate our wellness partners on?
