Thomas just grew up in Minnesota and got into boxing at a young age his boxing mentor taught him how to meditate and how to properly weightlift. Thomas just got hired as a salesforce employee and without his mentor its going to be a bit harder to stick to his wellness goals so when he was told about wellforce he instantly came on to find someone that could support his wellness goals.

Johnny has been working in salesforce for a decade but he recently moved to a new team in a different state and as he moved he also moved away from all of  his friends at his old location, these friends would be people he would run with. People he would go to the gym with and a multitude of other wellness activities. When he came to his new location he wanted to make new friends so he went on our wellness app so he could make new friends while being on track for his wellness goals.
